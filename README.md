# How to Use


Ex. 1: Minimize the cost function iteratively for the data set ...

x = [1,2,3,4,5] output(y) = [10,0,20,40,-20]

Solution:

[theta_0, theta_1] = iLinearRegression(x,y,m=5,alpha=0.4)

Which fits the form of the linear equation 'y = theta_0 + theata_1*x'


Ex. 2: Minimize the cost function using the normal equation for the data set ...

x = [1,2,3,4,5] output(y) = [10,0,20,40,-20]

Solution:

[theta_0, theta_1] = LinearRegression(x,y)

Which fits the form of the linear equation 'y = theta_0 + theata_1*x'
